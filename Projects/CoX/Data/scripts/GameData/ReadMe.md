The DataDumps folder contains data provided by City of Titans staff - it relates to data dumped from the I24 client.
The data in the Powersets folder contains json versions of the data separated by powerset - this data was extracted from the Mids Hero Designer Database files.
All of the above is I24 beta content.
Without having power implementation data for Issue 1 data - we may need to work backwards from I24 powers to get them similar to Issue 1.
